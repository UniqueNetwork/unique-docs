JavaScript API
==============

Polkadot JS API
---------------
The `Polkadot JS API <https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/>`_ is a constantly developed API for integration with Substrate based blockchains, which is maintained by Parity Inc.

This documentation does not focus on general features of this API, but mainly on using this API for integration with features of Unique Blockchain.

Installation
------------
The Polkadot JS API is available as an npm package and can be included in `package.json` file as::

    "@polkadot/api": "2.9.1",

Examples
--------

The examples are provided for this documentation in the `examples folder <https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-docs/tree/master/examples/>`_. In order to execute them, install NodeJS 15, clone this repository and run an example (e.g. connect.js)::

    cd examples
    npm install
    node connect.js 

Opening Connection
------------------

The Unique Network maintains public blockchain nodes to be used by clients for free. In order to connect to a client, you will need the public node URL and runtime types file that is located at https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/nft_parachain/runtime_types.json.

The public node URL depends on the network that you would like to connect to:

+-------------+--------------------------------+
| Network     | URL                            |
+=============+================================+
| TestNet 1.0 | wss://unique.usetech.com       |
+-------------+--------------------------------+
| TestNet 2.0 | wss://testnet2.uniquenetwork.io|
+-------------+--------------------------------+
| MainNet     | Coming soon...                 |
+-------------+--------------------------------+

Once you've got all parameters, connect to the node like this::

    const { ApiPromise, WsProvider, Keyring } = require('@polkadot/api');
    const rtt = require("./runtime_types.json");

    const wsProvider = new WsProvider(public_node_url);

    // Create the API and wait until ready
    const api = await ApiPromise.create({ 
        provider: wsProvider,
        types: rtt
    });

Collection Management
---------------------

Collection Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following query can be used to get collection state::

    await api.query.nft.collection(collectionId);

which returns an object like the following (for an NFT collection taken as example)::

createCollection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

This method creates a Collection of NFTs. Each Token may have multiple properties encoded as an array of bytes of certain length. The initial owner and admin of the collection are set to the address that signed the transaction. Both addresses can be changed later.

**Permissions**

* Anyone

**Parameters**

* collectionName: UTF-16 string with collection name (limit 64 characters) 
* collectionDescription: UTF-16 string with collection description (limit 256 characters) 
* tokenPrefix: UTF-8 string with token prefix, limit 16 characters
* collectionType:

    * 0 - Invalid (collection does not exist, if type is 0)
    * 1 - NFT. All items in ItemList are unique and indivisible (decimalPoints parameter must be 0). Item IDs are unique, and one item may only be owned by one address.
    * 2 - Fungible. Collection does not have custom data associated with token (custom data size parameter must be 0). All Item IDs are the same and all that is recorded in ItemList in value field is the owner address and owned amount. The value is fixed point decimal with decimalPoints set as in the parameter to this method.
    * 3 - Re-Fungible. Custom data is allowed, but Items IDs are not unique. One item may be owned by more than one address. Value in ItemList entry corresponds to the owned portion of token. Value is an integer number and corresponds to the number of owned pieces.
* decimalPoints: Decimal points to be used in token amounts. If set to 0, tokens are indivisible.

**Events**

* CollectionCreated

    * CollectionID: Globally unique identifier of newly created collection.
    * Owner: Collection owner



**Code example**:

::

    await api.tx.nft.createCollection();

* Collection Owner
* Collection Admin
* Current NFT Owner

**Parameters**

addCollectionAdmin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

    * Address is added to white list, and
    * This method was called with True parameter

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of the Collection to add admin for
* MintPermission: Boolean parameter. If True, allows minting to Anyone with conditions above.

setCollectionLimits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Sets some collection limits and starts enforcing them immediately (with no exception for collection owner or admins). By default the collection limits are not set, so for example, the number of items that an addres can own is not limited. When the limits are set, the current number of owned items will be checked, and if it already exceeds the limit, the transaction will fail. After the limits are set, they start being enforced.

Note that some bounds are also set by the global chain limits (see `setChainLimits`). The more restrictive limits will always apply. 

    * `AccountTokenOwnershipLimit` - Maximum number of tokens that one address can own. Default value is the maximum value of 10,000,000,000,000. When the number of tokens owned by a single address reaches this number, no more tokens can be transferred or minted to this address.
    * `SponsoredMintSize` - maximum byte size of custom NFT data that can be sponsored when tokens are minted in sponsored mode. If the amount of custom data is greater than this parameter when tokens are minted, then the transaction sender will pay transaction fees when minting tokens.
    * `TokenLimit`  - total amount of tokens that can be minted in this collection. Default value is the maximum value of 10,000,000,000,000. When the limit is set, the NFT pallet will check if the number of minted tokens is less or equal than the parameter value. If the number of minted tokens is greater than this number, the transaction will fail. This limit is designed to feacilitate token scarcity. So, it can only be set to a lower value than previous (or if previous value is default).
    * `SponsorTimeout` - Time interval in blocks that defines once per how long a non-privileged user transfer or mint transaction can be sponsored. Default value is 14400 (24 hrs), allowed values are from 0 (not limited) to 10,368,000 (1 month). 
    * `OwnerCanTransfer` - Boolean value that tells if collection owner or admins can transfer or burn tokens owned by other non-privileged users. This is a one-way switch: If it is ever disabled (set to `false`), it cannot be re-enabled (set back to `true`).
    * `OwnerCanDestroy` - Boolean value that tells if collection owner can destroy it. This is a one-way switch: If it is ever disabled (set to `false`), it cannot be re-enabled (set back to `true`).
    * `VariableMetaDataSponsoringRateLimit` - Time interval in blocks that defines once per how long a non-privileged user transaction to update variable metadata can be sponsored. Default value is 0 (never sponsored), allowed values are from 0 (never sponsored) to 10,368,000 (1 month).

* Item_owner: Default, user who owns the token.
* Admin: Only collection owner and admins can change variable metadata. A smart contract may also be made an admin in order to change token properties trustlessly.
* None: Nobody can update veriable metadata, including the token and collection owner. This option is irreversible. Once it is set, the variable token metadata becomes permanent in this collection.

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of the Collection to add admin for

    * variable_data: Mutable properties
    * pieces: Number of pieces this token is divided into

**Events**

* ItemCreated
    * CollectionID: ID of collection
    * ItemId: Depends on the collection type:
    
      * NFT: Identifier of newly created NFT. which is unique within the Collection, so the NFT is uniquely identified with a pair of values: CollectionId and ItemId.
      * Fungible: Item IDs are not used, so the value is just 0
      * ReFungible: Same as NFT
    * Recipient: Address that receives token

**Code example**:

::

    const nftItemId = await createItem(
        api,
        alice,
        nftCollectionId,
        // Token receiver
        alice.address,

            // Arbitary data assigned to token
            const_data: [1, 2, 3, 4],
            // Variable data can be set later with setVariableMetadata
            variable_data: [1, 2, 3, 4],
        },

    #. Transfer, Approve, and Burn: Check if the sender owns the token, or 
    #. TransferFrom: Check if the sender is approved to transfer this token. Collection Owner, Admins, and this token owner are always approved.
#. Check if the sender is the collection owner or an admin. If yes -> Allow transaction, no extra checks needed. If no -> go next.
#. Check if White List mode is enabled. If no -> Allow transaction, no extra checks needed. If yes -> go next.
#. Check if the sender is in the white list. If yes -> Allow transaction, no extra checks needed. If no -> Error.

Data Schema
-----------

setSchemaVersion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Set schema standard to one of:

* ImageURL (Image URL only, just like in TestNet 1.0)
* Unique
* OpenSea
* Tezos TZIP-16 (https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-16/tzip-16.md)

The data schema is used by NFT wallets in order to display the token metadata, as well as offchain token data (such as images, etc.) correctly in the wallet. `Unique Wallet <https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/nft>`_ currently supports `ImageURL` and `Unique` formats.

**Image URL**

This schema format assumes saving the image URL template in `constOnChainSchema`. The image template allows NFT wallets to reconstruct the full image URL for each token using its ID. The URL template can contain {id} placeholder that will be replaced with the actual token ID when the image URL is reconstructed.

Example::

    https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipns/QmaMtDqE9nhMX9RQLTpaCboqg7bqkb6Gi67iCKMe8NDpCE/images/punks/image{id}.png

**Unique**

The `Unique` format allows NFT wallets to decode on-chain token metadata and access off-chain data. This format is currently evolving and may update in the future. It supports three schemas: constant on-chain, variable on-chain, and off-chain. The schema is the JSON string that contains information about how to access and decode token metadata.

In case of off-chain metadata, the data is accessed at a 3rd party or an IPFS URL. URLs may contain the {id} placeholder that will be replaced by the wallet in order to reconstruct the URL for that resource. Currently the Unique Wallet only supports "metadata" entry (just like in the example below). The JSON object returned by the metadata endpoint must contain "image" key with image URL value.

In case of on-chain metadata, the data is binary (i.e. an array of bytes), and it is encoded with protobuf codec, so the schema shows how to deserialize that binary on-chain data into human readable entries. The off-chain schema has the same format as .proto files in protobuf serializer (see example below). The package name should always be equal to `onchainmetadata`, and the root object should always be named `NFTMeta`. In order to encode large strings for converting enum values in multiple languages, one can use JSON transaction object in the single line comments before the enum value in the enum definition (see the example).

Example for const or variable on-chain that is used by SubstraPunks (shortened version)::

    package onchainmetadata;
    syntax = "proto3";

    enum Gender {
        /// {"cn": "男性", "en": "Male", "ru": "Мужчина"}
        Male = 0;
        /// {"cn": "女性", "en": "Female", "ru": "Женщина"}
        Female = 1;
    };

    enum PunkTrait {
        /// {"cn": "黑唇", "en": "Black Lipstick", "ru": "Чёрная помада"}
        BLACK_LIPSTICK = 0;
        /// {"cn": "红唇", "en": "Red Lipstick", "ru": "Красная помада"}
        RED_LIPSTICK = 1;
        /// {"cn": "笑脸", "en": "Smile", "ru": "Улыбка"}
        SMILE = 2;
        /// {"cn": "露齿笑脸", "en": "Teeth Smile", "ru": "Улыбка с зубами"}
        TEETH_SMILE = 3;
        /// {"cn": "紫唇", "en": "Purple Lipstick", "ru": "Фиолетовая помада"}

Example of data returned from metadata endpoint for token ID 1::

    {
        "image" : "https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipns/QmaMtDqE9nhMX9RQLTpaCboqg7bqkb6Gi67iCKMe8NDpCE/images/punks/image1.png"
    }

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner
* Collection Admin

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection
* SchemaVersion: enum

setOffchainSchema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Set off-chain data schema. In the initial version of NFT parachain the schema will only reflect image URL. The {id} substring will be parsed to reflect the NFT id.

For example, the schema string for CryptoKitties will look like this::

    https://img.cryptokitties.co/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/{id}.png

Next version of the token data schema is split into three methods: SetOffchainSchema, SetConstOnChainSchema, and SetVariableOnChainSchema, as well as a chain variable: SchemaVersion, which will return the value corresponding to the metadata standard being used. If SchemaVersion is not present in the chain, it means this is still the TestNet 1.0 and there is no on-chain schema yet implemented in it.

The schema must contain the image and page fields, which should use `{id}` placeholder that will be replaced by wallets with the actual token ID in order to get the token page and image URLs. Also, there is an optional “audio” field that contains audio file URL associated with the tokens. The schema will be parsed by 3rd party wallets, but not at the moment of setting the schema.

Example::

    {
      “image”: “https://example.com/images/{id}”,
      “page”: “https://example.com/nft/{id}”,
      “audio”: “https://example.com/audio/{id}”
    }

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner
* Collection Admin

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection
* Schema: String representing the offchain data schema



setConstOnChainSchema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Set the on-chain schema (string in JSON-schema format) that describes permanent token fields.

This schema describes the serialization of non-changeable token fields. Serialization algorithm depends on the version of schema selected in `setSchemaVersion`_ . Uniue schema uses Google protobuf for serialization, which is described in `setSchemaVersion`_ .

The schema will be parsed by 3rd party wallets, but it is not validated at the moment when it is set.

Example: see example in `setSchemaVersion`_

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner
* Collection Admin

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection
* Schema: String representing the offchain data schema

setVariableOnChainSchema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Same as Const on-chain schema, except sets the variable schema. Also, requires name and size of each field and is required to match the total variable data size.

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner
* Collection Admin

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection
* Schema: String representing the offchain data schema

Getting Data Schemas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to get a data schema for the collection, one should use following query: `api.query.nft.collection`. The response to the query is the JSON object that contains schemas information in fields `OffchainSchema`, `VariableOnChainSchema`, and `ConstOnChainSchema`:

    {
      Owner: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY,
      Mode: {
        NFT: null
      },
      Access: Normal,
      DecimalPoints: 0,
      Name: [
        0
      ],
      Description: [
        0
      ],
      TokenPrefix: 0x3000,
      MintMode: false,
      OffchainSchema: "",
      Sponsor: 5C4hrfjw9DjXZTzV3MwzrrAr9P1MJhSrvWGWqi1eSuyUpnhM,
      SponsorConfirmed: false,
      VariableOnChainSchema: "",
      ConstOnChainSchema: ""
    }

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: Id of collection 

**Code Example**

::

    await api.query.nft.collection(collectionId);

Ecomonic Models
---------------

The Unique Network allows sponsoring user transactions for NFT collections and smart contracts. When collection (or smart contract) is sponsored, all their users need is to have the Unique wallet and address, but they don't need to have any Unique balance on the wallet. This feature removes the extra friction for the end user and creates nice flawless user expeirence.

setCollectionSponsor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Setting collection sponsor is the 2-step process. This method is the step 1: Set the sponsor address. The sponsor will need to confirm the sponsorship using `confirmSponsorship` method before the sponsoring begins.

**Permissions**

* Collection Owner

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection
* Sponsor: Sponsor address


confirmSponsorship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Setting collection sponsor is the 2-step process. This method is the step 2: Confirm sponsorship. The sponsor needs to confirm the sponsorship so that the collection owners cannot atack the addresses they are not related with.

**Permissions**

* Collection Sponsor

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection


removeCollectionSponsor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Disable sponsoring and switch back to pay-per-own-transaction model.

**Permissions**

* Collection owner

**Parameters**

* CollectionID: ID of collection

Enabling Contract Sponsoring (EVM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

In order to enable contract sponsoring on EVM (Ethereum) contract, web3 library needs to be used because EVM contracts are deployed using ETH RPC interface, so the owner of the EVM contract is an Ethereum address. This short example demonstrates how to enable sponsoring for a contract with address stored in `myContractAddress` variable::

    import Web3 from 'web3';
    ...
    const helpers = new web3.eth.Contract(contractHelpersAbi as any, '0x842899ECF380553E8a4de75bF534cdf6fBF64049', {from: caller, ...GAS_ARGS});
    await helpers.methods.toggleSponsoring(myContractAddress, true).send({from: owner});
    await helpers.methods.toggleAllowlist(myContractAddress, true).send({ from: owner });

Note that `helpers.methods.toggleAllowlist` call is also included in this example because enabling allow list is required in order for sponsoring to work (as a security measure). Read more about this below.

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract to sponsor
* enable: Boolean flag to enable or disable smart contact self-sponsoring


enableContractSponsoring (Ink!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Note: The Ink! smart contracts are currently disabled.

Enable the Ink! smart contract to pay for its own transaction using its endowment. Can only be called by the contract owner, i.e. address that deployed this smart contract. The sponsoring will only start working after the rate limit is set with `setContractSponsoringRateLimit-ink`_.

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract to sponsor
* enable: Boolean flag to enable or disable smart contact self-sponsoring

Settings Contract Sponsoring Rate Limit (EVM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Set the rate limit for contract sponsoring. The default value for the rate limit is 7200 blocks, i.e. one day. If set to the number B (for blocks), the transactions will be sponsored with a rate limit of B, i.e. fees for every transaction sent to this smart contract will be paid from contract balance if there are at least B blocks between such transactions. Nonetheless, if transactions are sent more frequently, the fees are paid by the sender.

This short example demonstrates how to set sponsoring rate limit of one transaction per 1234 blocks for a contract with address stored in `myContractAddress` variable::

    import Web3 from 'web3';
    ...
    const helpers = new web3.eth.Contract(contractHelpersAbi as any, '0x842899ECF380553E8a4de75bF534cdf6fBF64049', {from: caller, ...GAS_ARGS});
    await helpers.methods.setSponsoringRateLimit(myContractAddress, 1234).send({from: owner});

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract to sponsor
* rate_limit: Number of blocks to wait until the next sponsored transaction is allowed


setContractSponsoringRateLimit (Ink!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: The Ink! smart contracts are currently disabled.

**Description**

Set the rate limit for contract sponsoring. If not set (has the default value of 0 blocks), the sponsoring will be disabled. If set to the number B (for blocks), the transactions will be sponsored with a rate limit of B, i.e. fees for every transaction sent to this smart contract will be paid from contract endowment if there are at least B blocks between such transactions. Nonetheless, if transactions are sent more frequently, the fees are paid by the sender.

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract to sponsor
* rate_limit: Number of blocks to wait until the next sponsored transaction is allowed


Sponsor Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sponsoring smart contracts is tricky. Users can generate addresses very quickly because creating an address is as simple as generating a random 64-byte sequence. So, it is really hard to prevent someone from making very many smart contract calls if they are sponsored. But the sponsor funds need to be protected.

One way to protect funds is to introduce severe rate limits globally, i.e. for all users of the smart contract, but it also degrades the user experience, especially if there are malicious players who race for free contract calls.

The `setContractSponsoringRateLimit-ink`_ only limits the call rate for each address, so it is designed to be used with White Lists, enabled by `toggleContractWhiteList`_, when the number of addresses is limited.

So the quick recipe for secure smart contract sponsoring is::

    RATE LIMIT + WHITE LIST

The contract owner (address that deployed it) can add user addresses to the white lists using `addToContractWhiteList-ink`_ method. For a dApp this can be combined with user registration, when the account is confirmed (or captcha or KYC is passed, for example).

Toggle Contract Allow List (EVM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

In order to enable allow list on an EVM (Ethereum) contract, web3 library needs to be used because EVM contracts are deployed using ETH RPC interface, so the owner of the EVM contract is an Ethereum address. This short example demonstrates how to enable allow lists for a contract with address stored in `myContractAddress` variable::

    import Web3 from 'web3';
    ...
    const helpers = new web3.eth.Contract(contractHelpersAbi as any, '0x842899ECF380553E8a4de75bF534cdf6fBF64049', {from: caller, ...GAS_ARGS});
    await helpers.methods.toggleAllowlist(myContractAddress, true).send({ from: owner });

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the EVM contract
* enable: Boolean that tells to either enable (if true) or disable (if false) the allow list for that EVM smart contract

toggleContractWhiteList (Ink!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Enable the white list for a contract. If enabled, only addresses added to the white list with `addToContractWhiteList-ink`_ (as well as the contract owner) will be able to call this smart contract. If disabled, all addresses can call this smart contract.

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract
* enable: Boolean that tells to either enable (if true) or disable (if false) the white list for that smart contract

Managing Allow List for EVM Contracts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

A user will be able to call the smart contract only if their address is included in the contract allow list.

This short example uses web3 library and demonstrates how to add or remove a user address to/from the smart contract allow list. The contract address is stored in `myContractAddress` variable::

    import Web3 from 'web3';
    ...
    const helpers = new web3.eth.Contract(contractHelpersAbi as any, '0x842899ECF380553E8a4de75bF534cdf6fBF64049', {from: caller, ...GAS_ARGS});
    await helpers.methods.toggleAllowed(myContractAddress, caller, true).send({from: owner});

**Permissions**

* Address that deployed smart contract

**Parameters**

* contractAddress: Address of the contract
* Address to add/remove
* enable: Boolean flag. True means address is included in the allow list and can call the contract. False means address cannot call the contract.

addToContractWhiteList (Ink!)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
